FILE DESCRIPTION: SNR_TianQin, SNR_LISA

The suffix of the files is log10(m), where m is the observed mass of the super massive black hole in solar masses.

Each file contains 18 lines with 36 columns.

The lines correspond to the ecliptic colatitutes -pi*85/180, -pi*75/180, ..., pi*85/180, respectively.

The columns correspond to the ecliptic longitudes pi*5/180, pi*15/180, ..., pi*355/180, respectively.

The sources are set at a luminosity distance of 20 Mpc, with an average inlcination of delta = pi/6. The mass of the small black hole is fixed at 30 solar masses and the observation time is 2 years.
